# Viral Sim - Corona Crowd Simulation
Created as part of the WirVsVirus Hackathon of the Federal Government of Germany.

# Inspiration
Inspired by an article in the Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) we have set ourselves the goal of creating a simulation for the spread of a virus that can be influenced by input parameters.

# What it does
The simulation shows which measures can be taken to keep the curve of infected persons flat. This makes it possible to prevent deaths due to lack of hospital capacity. At the same time, the importance of social distance in the current situation becomes clear. And the phenomenon of herd immunity can be simulated.

# How we built it
It is very complex to create a simulation that corresponds to the real world. But this is not at all the claim to our project. Rather, we want to use simple means to illustrate the influence that restricting movement, for example, has on the spread of a virus. At the same time, the importance of restricting movement will be shown, since otherwise hospital beds are not sufficient and thus significantly higher mortality rates are quickly reached.

# What's next
* Making simulation more realistic
* Complete revision of the UI
* Changing the parameters during the simulation

Many thanks to djmot for the particle collision simulation (https://codepen.io/djmot/pen/XNQEBy), which saved us a lot of work.
